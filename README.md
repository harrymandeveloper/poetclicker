# Poet Clicker
A simple Python based demo poetry game for my Lyric AI class. 

Click on Joy Harjo's image (or poet of your choice) and receive a line of poetry in the command line.

(Written with apologies to Joy Harjo. You can find and buy Joy Harjo's books here: https://www.joyharjo.com/books)

To run, install pygame: https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted

cd into the root folder and run:

```pgzrun poemclicker.py```
